Q.Given an array with the lengths of various metal rods, repeatedly perform the following

1. Count the number of rods.

2. Find the rod(s) with the shortest length. 3. Discard any rod of that length.

4. Cut that shortest length from each of the longer rods. These are offcuts.

5. Discard all offcuts.

6. Repeat until there are no more rods.

Maintain an array of the numbers of rods at the beginning of each round of actions and return that array.




var arr : [Int] = [1,1,3,4]
var ans : [Int] = []

func rod (ar: inout [Int]) {
    ans.append(ar.count)
    for i in (0..<ar.count).reversed() {
        if ar[0] == ar[i] {
            ar.remove(at: i)
        } else {
            ar[i] = ar[i] - ar[0]
        }
    }
    if !ar.isEmpty {
        rod(ar: &ar)
    }
}

rod(ar: &arr)


let an = ans.map{ s in
    return "\(s) elements at start"
}

for i in an{
    print(i)
}



Output:

4 elements at start
2 elements at start
1 elements at start
