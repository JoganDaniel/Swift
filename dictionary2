Q. Write a Python program that partitions this dictionary into two sub-dictionaries:
1.admittedStudents whose keys are the admitted students and the key values are the averages obtained (average greater than or equal to 10).
2.nonAdmittedStudents whose keys are non-admitted students and the key values are the averages obtained (average less than 10).



var students  = ["student_1" : 13 , "student_2" : 17 , "student_3" : 9 , "student_4" : 15 ,
             "student_5" : 8 , "student_6" : 14 , "student_7" : 16 , "student_8" : 12 ,
             "student_9" : 13 , "student_10" : 15 , "student_11" : 14 , "student_112" : 9 ,
             "student_13" : 10 , "student_14" : 12 , "student_15" : 13 , "student_16" : 7 ,
             "student_17" : 12 , "student_18" : 15 , "student_19" : 9 , "student_20" : 17 ,]


var admittedStudents : [String:Int] = [:]
var nonadmittedStudents : [String:Int] = [:]
for name in students.keys
{
    let mark : Int = students[name]!
    if mark >= 10{
        admittedStudents[name] = mark
    }
    else{
        nonadmittedStudents[name] = mark
    }
}

for (name,mark) in admittedStudents{
    print("\(name) has scored \(mark) marks and will be admitted")
}

print("")
for (name,mark) in nonadmittedStudents{
    print("\(name) has scored \(mark) marks and will not be admitted")
}


Output:

student_7 has scored 16 marks and will be admitted
student_11 has scored 14 marks and will be admitted
student_9 has scored 13 marks and will be admitted
student_10 has scored 15 marks and will be admitted

student_6 has scored 14 marks and will be admitted
student_13 has scored 10 marks and will be admitted
student_14 has scored 12 marks and will be admitted
student_20 has scored 17 marks and will be admitted

student_17 has scored 12 marks and will be admitted
student_8 has scored 12 marks and will be admitted
